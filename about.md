## Nomenclature

* Hashtag: #devteamup
* Domain: devteamup.org

## Target of the project

> Help and push developers to team up

By working in group we believe that developers learn and produce faster.

Solo developers involved in a development team break their isolation, feel better and contribute more.

We also want to apply the concept of mentoring to team work: this should enhance the productive of mentores and mentorees.
