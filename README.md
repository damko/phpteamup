## Premise

Developing in team is fun and it's a great way to learn. 

A good team enhances the skills of its members, pushes them towards new limits and leverages on their diversity to get the best.

Also, the complexity of modern development makes it **mandatory** because nobody can keep up with **everything**.

## Problem

Teaming up with other developers can be hard, especially in the early stage.

Mentoring is a great option but it doesn't exactly mean "teaming up" since it's a one-to-one relationship. Also, mentoring can be resource consuming for the mentor.

Joining a project on Github or Gitlab is a good way to go but "technical debt", "impostor syndrome", "shyness" and, sometimes, "social barriers" (of any kind) get in the way.

## Solution

PHP TeamUp is a web application that helps people to team up and grow under the guidance of a mentor who will be able to leverage on the team mutual support and train more people at once.

The current draft goes like this:

> Monalisa is an experienced developer who wants to get better on PHPunit testing. She writes a statement like this one:

    **I want to** write a _container traking application_ as a proof of concept
    **in order to** deepen the PHP unit testing.
    **I plan to use**:
        * slim framework
        * composer
    **Additional details** the application will be a RESTful API with no GUI
    **Tags**: phpunit, testing

> Monalisa's statement gets published

> Vladimir and Stella are young students with little or no experience who have heard about the importance of testing. They apply to Monalisa's project.

> Mario feels quite confident with PHPunit but he's a bit rusty on git because he rarely works in team. He applies to Monalisa's project too.

> Monalisa gets notified about the join-requests and speaks with them all. She drops Stella because she lacks the basics but she feels good with all the others. So she approves their requests. A team just born.

> The team asks the available mentors listed in [phpmentoring.org](http://dev.app.phpmentoring.org/mentors) for support.

> Jing accepts to be a mentor. He reads Monalisa's statement, talks to the team and helps them to tackle the problem from the right angle.

> The team starts working on the project and goes back to the mentor for help only when stuck.

> When the project seems complete, the mentor reviews the job with the team.

**Note:**

Monalisa's statement could also be any open source ticket, for instance, one of those tagged "Easy Pick"
