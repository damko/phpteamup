# Architecture

## Overview
The idea is to separate DevTeamUp into few smaller applications, which can talk to each other via APIs.
That way, development process would be easier to manage (there can be different teams, each working on one of the parts).
Also, separated architecture is more flexible. We could use each sub-app in many ways, maximising usefullness of DevTeamUp in general.

For now, we're thinking about three apps - Domain, Contacts, and Frontend.

## DevTeamUp Domain
This would be the heart of the project, holding all the domain logic, responsible for managing user interaction.

## DevTeamUp DevBook
Reposible for holding user data and managing authentication. We're thinking about private and public layers. Private for 
DevTeamUp usage only (with all the sensitive stuff), and public for authentication (may be used by anyone).

## DevTeamUp Frontend
Face of the application. Responsible for everything that happens on the client's side.
